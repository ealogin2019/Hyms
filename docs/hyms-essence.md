✅ Hyms Essence & Quality Checklist (Authoritative)

This checklist sits above features, above architecture, and above implementation details.

If something violates this, we don’t ship it, even if it “works”.

1) Core Essence (Non-negotiable)

Hyms must feel:

Fluid in motion

Minimal in presentation

Aesthetic without decoration

Quiet, calm, confident

Precise in intent (buyer or seller always knows what to do next)

Single sentence definition

Hyms is a fluid, minimal marketplace that does one thing at a time — extremely well.

2) Fluid Dynamics UI (New checklist section)

Every interaction must pass these tests:

Motion & Flow

No abrupt screen jumps

Navigation feels continuous, not segmented

Transitions feel intentional, not default

Scroll position is respected

Back always feels safe

Interaction Rules

One primary action per screen

Secondary actions are visually quieter

No competing CTAs

No unnecessary confirmations

Touch & Feedback

Taps always respond (ripple, motion, navigation)

No “dead” UI

Feedback is subtle, not loud

3) Minimal & Aesthetic (Visual Discipline)
What we allow

White/negative space

Large imagery

Few words

Calm typography

Clear hierarchy

What we do NOT allow

Dense lists

Overlapping metadata

Multiple badges competing for attention

Decorative UI without purpose

“Marketplace noise”

If a screen looks busy → it’s wrong, even if Vinted does it.

4) Precision of Purpose (Seller / Buyer clarity)

Every screen must answer one of these clearly:

Buyer mode

“What is this?”

“Is it worth my attention?”

“What can I do next?”

Seller mode

“What information is needed now?”

“Is my progress saved?”

“What’s the next step?”

If a screen tries to serve both buyer and seller at once, it fails.

5) Feature Scope Discipline (Anti-Clutter Rule)

For every feature:

Tier 1 (what we’re building now)

Only essentials

No “advanced” options visible

No power-user controls

Defaults do the work

Advanced options must be:

Hidden

Deferred

Progressive (shown only when needed)

6) Vinted Alignment (Reframed Correctly)

We align with Vinted in:

Marketplace mechanics

Seller → buyer trust flows

Persistence, drafts, caching

Feature completeness roadmap

We do not align with Vinted in:

Visual density

UI patterns

Information overload

Interaction sequencing

Rule:

If Hyms ever looks like Vinted, we redesign it.

7) Engineering ↔ UX Contract

Code decisions must support UX essence:

No business logic in UI

No UI workarounds for bad data flow

Persistence first, UI second

Predictable state transitions

No “temporary hacks” that leak to UX

If code complexity increases UI clutter → refactor.

8) Definition of Done (Updated)

A feature is done only if:

✅ Fluid to use

✅ Minimal in UI

✅ Aesthetic without decoration

✅ Precise in intent (buyer or seller)

✅ No clutter

✅ UK defaults respected

✅ Drafts / state persist

✅ Navigation feels safe

✅ No visual or cognitive overload

9) Where this applies immediately

Home feed ✔️ (already aligned)

Recently viewed rail ✔️ (subtle, optional)

Sell flow ✔️ (wizard, one step at a time)

Photo picker (next) → must be minimal

Listing detail → image-first, not metadata-first
